        Which loop to prefer:-
        1) If you know the number of iteration in advance, the for loop is often the most suitable.
        2) If you want to execute the loop at least once, the do-while loop is appropriate.
        3) If you are uncertain about the number of iterations and the loop termination is based on a condition,
        the while loop is a good choice.
